Location-Based Intelligence
Preventing the spread of COVID-19 with location-based data.
Like any virus, COVID-19 travels along vectors or pathways that can be predicted– if you have spatial location data and an app to display it. That’s why LEETintelligence developed a location-based COVID-19 map and Mobile APP to alert you about COVID-19 cases in your area so you can be prepared and take action to prevent the spread of infections.
